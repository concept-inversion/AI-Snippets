Various algorithm implemented in python

## Learning in AI:
 Learning is a technique by which a machine/alogirthm learns from example or experience.
There are three broad types of learning:
a) Supervised Learning 
b) Unsupervised Learning
c) Reinforced Learning

### a) Supervised Learning:
 It is a machine learning algorithm in which machine learns through examples having both input and the desired output. The output label in the examples supervises the machine in learning how to perform the task in various state of attributes. Its just like teaching a kid to do a task by mentoring them.

### b) Unsupervised Learning: 
It is a ML algorithm in which machine have to learn through examples where the desired output is not mentioned in the examples. The algorithm have to learn how to perform tasks on their own. Their is no clue on what the output type is.

#### 1. Linear Regression:

  Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two or more       continuous (quantitative) variables. 
  
  A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent     variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
  
  
  Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or not there is a          relationship between the variables of interest. This does not necessarily imply that one variable causes the other (for     example, higher SAT scores do not cause higher college grades), but that there is some significant association between the two  variables. A scatterplot can be a helpful tool in determining the strength of the relationship between two variables. If there  appears to be no association between the proposed explanatory and dependent variables (i.e., the scatterplot does not indicate  any increasing or decreasing trends), then fitting a linear regression model to the data probably will not provide a useful   model.


#### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).
