## 1. Linear Regression:

  Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two or more       continuous (quantitative) variables. 
  
  A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent     variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
  
  
  Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or not there is a          relationship between the variables of interest. This does not necessarily imply that one variable causes the other (for     example, higher SAT scores do not cause higher college grades), but that there is some significant association between the two  variables. A scatterplot can be a helpful tool in determining the strength of the relationship between two variables. If there  appears to be no association between the proposed explanatory and dependent variables (i.e., the scatterplot does not indicate  any increasing or decreasing trends), then fitting a linear regression model to the data probably will not provide a useful   model.


## 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).
